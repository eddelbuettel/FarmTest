\usage{
farm.test(X, fX = NULL, KX = -1, Y = NULL, fY = NULL, KY = -1,
  h0 = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An \eqn{n} by \eqn{p} data matrix with each row being a sample.}

\item{fX}{An \strong{optional} factor matrix with each column being a factor for \code{X}. The number of rows of \code{fX} and \code{X} must be the same.}

\item{KX}{An \strong{optional} positive number of factors to be estimated for \code{X} when \code{fX} is not specified. \code{KX} cannot exceed the number of columns of \code{X}. If \code{KX} is not specified, it will be estimated internally.}

\item{Y}{An \strong{optional} data matrix used for two-sample FarmTest. The number of columns of \code{X} and \code{Y} must be the same.}

\item{fY}{An \strong{optional} factor matrix for two-sample FarmTest with each column being a factor for \code{Y}. The number of rows of \code{fY} and \code{Y} must be the same.}

\item{KY}{An \strong{optional} positive number of factors to be estimated for \code{Y} for two-sample FarmTest when \code{fY} is not specified. \code{KY} cannot exceed the number of columns of \code{Y}. If \code{KY} is not specified, it will be estimated internally.}

\item{h0}{An \strong{optional} \eqn{p}-vector of true means, or difference in means for two-sample FarmTest. The default is a zero vector.}

\item{alternative}{An \strong{optional} character string specifying the alternate hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "less" or "greater".}

\item{alpha}{An \strong{optional} level for controlling the false discovery rate. The value of \code{alpha} must be between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.05.}
