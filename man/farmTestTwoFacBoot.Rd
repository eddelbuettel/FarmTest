\title{Two sample FarmTest with known factors and multiplier bootstrap}
\usage{
farmTestTwoFacBoot(X, facX, Y, facY, h0, alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided", B = 500L)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An \eqn{nX} by \eqn{p} data matrix with each row being a sample.}

\item{facX}{A factor matrix with each column being a factor for \code{X}. The number of rows of \code{facX} and \code{X} must be the same.}

\item{Y}{An \eqn{nY} by \eqn{p} data matrix with each row being a sample. The number of columns of \code{X} and \code{Y} must be the same.}

\item{facY}{A factor matrix with each column being a factor for \code{Y}. The number of rows of \code{facY} and \code{Y} must be the same.}

\item{h0}{A \eqn{p}-vector of true difference in means.}

\item{alpha}{An \strong{optional} level for controlling the false discovery rate. The value of \code{alpha} must be between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.05.}

\item{alternative}{An \strong{optional} character string specifying the alternate hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "less" or "greater".}

\item{B}{An \strong{optional} positive integer specifying the size of bootstrap sample. The dafault value is 500.}

\description{
Internal function implemented in C++ for two sample FarmTest with known factors, where p-values are obtained via multiplier bootstrap. 
This case is incorporated into \code{farm.test}.
