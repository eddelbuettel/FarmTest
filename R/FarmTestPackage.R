#' FarmTest: Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing
#'
#' This package performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent factors. 
#' It implements a robust procedure to estimate distribution parameters using Huber loss function with a tuning-free principle and accounts for strong dependence among coordinates via an approximate factor model. 
#' This method is particularly suitable for high dimensional data when there are many variables but only a small number of observations available. 
#' Moreover, the method is tailored to cases when the underlying distribution deviates from Gaussian, which is commonly assumed in the literature.
#' Besides the results of hypotheses testing, the estimated underlying factors and diagnostic plots are also output.
