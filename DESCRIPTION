Description: FarmTest package performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent factors.
             It implements a series of adaptive Huber methods combined with fast data-drive tuning schemes to estimate model parameters and construct test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and/or assymetric error distributions. 
             Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean comparison problems are also included. 
             As by-products, this package also contains functions that compute adaptive Huber mean and covariance matrix estimators that are of independent interest.
